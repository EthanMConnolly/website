        <P>For work experience, I worked at the shop, ‘Carpetright.’ This was in Wisbech. During my time there, I welcomed customers as they came through the door and cleaned the shop by hoovering up. <br> <br>
             I worked with two other staff members who I got on well with and they taught me about the type of roles that are required when working there. <br> <br>
             I also stacked shelves and sometimes helped carry heavy objects into someone’s vehicle.</P>

         <img src="PHOTOS/EACH.png" alt="Work2" class="center"> 
     <p> I previously volunteered over the summer at a charity shop in Whittlesey. This was for a children’s Hospice, and it was called, ‘EACH.’ <br> <br>
      While volunteering, I stacked shelves and worked at the back of the store, putting price tags on items such as: Books, Clothes and DVDs. <br> <br>
      I also wrote prices on the tags. I also worked with a few staff members who made me feel welcomed and helped me when I found some aspects of my job challenging. <br> <br> </p>

    <img src="PHOTOS/5-star.png" alt="Work3" class="center">
    <p>I once did an apprenticeship at a workplace known as 5-Star Cases. While working there, I learned how to deal with customers over the phone and information about their company. <br> <br>
       I also processed orders and wrote professional emails to customers. Unfortunately, my contract with 5-star Cases ended because some aspects of the role I struggled with. <br> <br>
        For example, I couldn't get use to the system they used. <br> <br>
       However, I tried my best to understand some of the aspects of my role and I did come out with more confidence and got some valuable work experience out of this job. <br> <br> </p>

        <p>I did work experience at APH (Agricultural Plant Hire) This place was located just on the outskirts of Coates. <br> <br>
        This was where my dad worked, and I was able to do work experience at this company. I had a book that provided information about combines and I was able to insert the data into their systems. <br> <br>
        They used software called, ‘SAP.’ I learnt how to navigate their systems and how to insert data. <br> <br>
         It also helped me develop the skill of observation, looking for what I was supposed to input. <br> <br> </p>
