                In my spare time, I like to play video games. I mostly play games on my PC. <br>
                One of the games I most like to play is Minecraft. <br> <br>
                My favourite type of game is one where you can compete against your friends. <br> <br> Playing video games have allowed me to attain some transferable skills. <br>
                For example, playing with my friends have given me communication skills. <br> <br>
                Playing games like Minecraft have also given me skills like creativity. <br> <br>
                Playing other types of game have allowed me to be dedicated to do my best. <br>
                     These skills are what I want to carry with me and use on the job.

                    Every Sunday I go to Church. <br>
                    Within the Church, I have certain roles. Sometimes, my friend and I are on a rota where <br>
                    we are instructed to help serve the fellowship. <br>
                    We make tea and coffee and serve them to anyone who comes on a Sunday. <br> <br>
                    We also put out biscuits for people to enjoy and at the end, we make sure we leave everything <br>
                    clean and tidy, ready to be used during the week. <br>
                    I am also put on a rota where I am doing tech. <br>
                    This role requires me to be at the back of the Church and control the screens at the front. <br>
                    I use a software program called ‘Zionworks.’ This software allows me to put Bible verses on the screens. <br>
                    It also allows me to show lyrics to various worship songs.<br>

                    In my spare time I like hanging out with my family and friends. <br>
                    I sometimes go to Church events where I spend time playing games with my friends. e.g pool and using a football table. <br> <br>
                    I also like to see them outside of Church and often go on walks with them. <br>
                    I also like family parties I attend and I enjoy chatting with people and playing with my little cousins as well. <br> <br>
                    I like to be very family oriented.

                    I occasionally like going on walks. This can be with family or friends. <br> <br>
                    I mostly walk with my parents. Often, we will drive to a place that is suitable for walking. <br> <br>
                    We normally do an hours walk. Going outside we can walk some places that have a beautiful view.
